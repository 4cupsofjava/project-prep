## Project Idea 1: Code 201 Review Game

- Summary of idea: We are creating a educational game geared towards beginners where keywords like "prototype," "method," "element," "selector," and other recurring words that are hard to remember. There will potentially be a function that listens for a mouse hover, clicks, and returns answers. Local storage could be utilize to save participant past quizzes.  We could also chart progress of player score over time.

- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough): We are learning so many new words in class, it would be great to spend our project time reviewing terminology and having fun and build out a website that helps us learn while we do our project at the same time! With missed questions for the player, we can provide reference links for the person to learn more about the topic.

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition: Start with a list of comment words, click on the page with a brief description, then hover your mouse to reveal answers. Each team member could be responsible for a different theme page could have their own multiple choice quiz page that keeps score for players.

- What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? A template website with one master game with multiple choice questions and answers.  The following link pages could be designed by each team member.
